# ðŸš€ ublacklist-filters
Blocks GitHub and StackOverflow scrapers from search results and other sites I find annoying.

## âœ¨ How to install
1. [Get uBlacklist](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist)
2. [Subscribe to my blacklist](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name=detachhead's%20blacklist&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdetachhead%2Fublacklist-filters%2Fmaster%2Fblacklist.txt) (or use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DetachHead/ublacklist-filters/master/blacklist.txt) if that doesn't work. see [how to manually add a subscription](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs/advanced-features#subscription))

That's it sir
